#ShopIT- By Psueduo Coders
. ShopIT is an e-commerce website developed by our team Pseudo Coders for this webathon. It focuses on selling electronic products like keyboards, mice, headphones, and more. The project was built using provided frontend elements, which we integrated into a fully responsive and animated user interface.

Key features include user registration and login with secure password storage using MySQL. The design is responsive across all devices and enhanced with scroll-triggered animations and a custom loader for better user experience. A collapsible side menu provides easy navigation, while the homepage features a black background with animated text that transitions into the siteâ€™s branding. As users scroll, various sections appear with smooth animations.

An infinite marquee showcasing different tech products is included at the bottom, along with a partially implemented image grid for product display. The project successfully integrates all required frontend components such as the navbar, loader, animated text, collapsible menu, infinite marquee, and image grid, wrapped in a clean and engaging layout.
